# Themes Collection for Rofi Launcher

## What is Rofi?

Rofi is A window switcher, Application launcher and dmenu replacement.
Rofi started as a clone of simpleswitcher and It has been extended with extra features,
like an application launcher and ssh-launcher, and can act as a drop-in dmenu replacement,
making it a very versatile tool. Rofi, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of
options where one or more can be selected. This can either be running an application, selecting
a window, or options provided by an external script. You can learn more about Rofi [here](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi).
